# devops-app

**DevOpsApp
Overview
The DevOpsApp project is a web-based application built with Java, Maven, and MySQL, designed to showcase the implementation of DevOps principles and practices such as continuous integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure management. The application includes basic functionalities like user registration and login, and demonstrates database connectivity and web interaction through servlets.

Features
User Registration and Login: Users can register and log in to the application using a MySQL database backend.

Database Integration: The application interacts with a MySQL database to store user credentials securely.

Servlets: Java servlets handle the logic for registering new users and managing login functionality.

Maven Integration: Maven is used to manage project dependencies and build the application.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure the following are installed and configured on your system:

Java 8 or later
You need to have Java installed. You can verify your installation using:

bash
Copy
Edit
java -version
Maven
This project uses Apache Maven for building the application. Verify Maven is installed using:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn -v
MySQL Database
MySQL 5.7 or later is required. You will need to create a database and set up user credentials for the app.

Tomcat (Optional)
If you wish to deploy the project as a web application, you can use Apache Tomcat or any servlet container.

Setting Up the Environment
Follow these steps to set up the environment on your system:

1. Install MySQL on Ubuntu
Install MySQL server and client:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client
2. Configure MySQL for the Project
Start MySQL:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl start mysql
Log into MySQL as root:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mysql -u root -p
Create a database:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE devopsapp;
Create a user for the application:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON devopsapp.* TO 'root'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
3. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devops-app.git
cd devops-app
4. Build the Project Using Maven
Once you have cloned the project, you can build the application using Maven:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install
This will compile the project, run any tests, and package it as a WAR file (if configured for deployment).

5. Database Schema
Make sure the DBConnection class connects to the database. Here's the schema of the database (devopsapp):

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
6. Configure the Database Connection
Make sure the DBConnection.java file in your project contains the correct database connection string and credentials:

java
Copy
Edit
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/devopsapp";
String user = "root";
String password = "admin123";
7. Deploying the Application
If you are using Apache Tomcat to deploy the web application, you can copy the WAR file generated in the target/ directory to the Tomcat webapps/ directory. Tomcat will automatically deploy the application.

Alternatively, you can run the application directly using Maven if it's configured to use an embedded server.

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn jetty:run

src/main/java/com/devopsapp/DBConnection.java: Contains the database connection logic.

src/main/java/com/devopsapp/LoginServlet.java: Handles the user login functionality.

src/main/java/com/devopsapp/RegisterServlet.java: Handles the user registration functionality.

src/main/java/com/devopsapp/TestDB.java: Contains a main method for testing database connections.

pom.xml: The Maven configuration file for managing dependencies and build processes.

Running the Application
Start MySQL server if it's not already running:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl start mysql
Build and run the application using Maven:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install
mvn jetty:run
Access the application through the browser:

Visit http://localhost:8080 to see the application in action.

Troubleshooting
Access Denied Error in MySQL:
Ensure that MySQL user credentials are correct and that you’ve granted the necessary privileges to the root user.

Maven Build Issues:
Ensure Maven is installed and you have all necessary dependencies. You can resolve dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install
